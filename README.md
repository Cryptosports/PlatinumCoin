Platinum Coin

https://plt.co.in

Originally built for linux as PLT Coin , but rebranded to PTC as to avoid confusion with the fine folks at PlayToken.

Also rebuilt on a new genesis block , with compiled Windows binaries in the Binaries folder. 
That was about as much fun as taking the S.A.T , but to keep things among the mining community fair we wanted to release a client for the Windows community. Linux QT wallet is also precompiled but results may vary.
About 400 blocks were generated between the 2 machines used to create and test the genesis block , and the network. 
My original build never sent the money to the other wallet, a few weeks of testing have gone into this, but its still a work in progress.
There was also a snafu in the checkpoint creation where the timestamp got recorded as the number of blocks. It may show 138888888 blocks in the wallet but the actual number is in the crawler on the website and also fixes itself when setgenerate=true and you start mining.
Its at about 280 at the time of this writing.
I will update and recompile it soon. Most artwork was changed from plt to ptc, but we may have missed some.
Thanks for your support
